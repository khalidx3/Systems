      towers (num, 'A', 'C', 'B');  
      return 0;  
   
}  
     void towers( int num, char from peg, char topeg, char auxpeg)  
 {  
           if (num == 1)

       printf ("\n Move disk 1 from peg %c to peg %c", from peg, topeg);  
           return;  
 }  
   Towers (num - 1, from peg, auxpeg, topeg);  
    Printf ("\n Move disk %d from peg %c to peg %c", num, from peg, topeg);
